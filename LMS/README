 Library Management System

This project implements a library management system to track books, authors, borrowers, and borrowing activities.

 Project Goals

* Design a system using C data structures and functions.
* Manage book information (title, author, ISBN, availability).
* Track borrower details (name, ID).
* Allow adding, issuing, and returning books.
* Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
* Display book and borrower records.

 Technologies Used

* C Programming Language
* Arrays
* Strings
* Pointers
* Functions
* Function Overloading

  Getting Started

This project requires a C compiler and a basic understanding of C programming concepts.

  Understanding the Code

The code consists of several key components:

* *Data Structures:* We define structures for Book and Borrower to hold information about books and borrowers.
* *Arrays:* Separate arrays store book and borrower information.
* *Functions:* Modular functions handle adding, issuing, returning books, displaying records, and searching.
* *Function Overloading:* Search functions are overloaded to enable searching by title, author, or ISBN.
* *Dynamic Memory Management:* Pointers are used to manage the dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory for borrowed books within the borrower structure.

  Documentation

Detailed comments are included within the code to explain each function's purpose and implementation.

  Running the Program

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
2. Execute the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the library management system.

*Note:* Specific compilation instructions will depend on your chosen compiler and environment.

  Further Enhancements

* Implement user interface elements for a more interactive experience.
* Add functionalities like managing borrower memberships, setting due dates for borrowed books, and generating reports.
* Integrate database connectivity for persistent data storage.

This project provides a foundation for a library management system. You can extend it further to incorporate additional features and functionalities.
